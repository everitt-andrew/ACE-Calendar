## Project & Description
This project will develop the project that my group and I worked on and failed to complete in its entirety during the Introduction to Computer Science course (111) during the Fall 2016 semester. This project was intended to serve as a calendar that the user could run in order to plan for events (and assignments for students). In addition to serving the same purpose as any calendar application on a smartphone, it would feature a ranking system in which the user could assign numerical values to each event, encouraging them to finish higher priority items sooner, if possible. Furthermore, the application would be able to tell the user how many days until the event occurs or assignment is due regardless of the amount of time between it and the current date. It would also provide the user with reminders/check-ups depending on its priority. I would also like to add the ability to choose between different profiles so that different people could use the program without seeing all events that have been entered. If I had unlimited time to complete the project, I would want to implement a clean user-interface instead of running the program in the terminal.

## Building & Running the Program
The user simply needs to run the code `python3 calendar.py` in the terminal

## Testing the Application

## Tools Used
The original version of the program was built in Java, but I have decided to use Python for this project because I am currently using it in my other computer science courses and personally find it more enjoyable.
